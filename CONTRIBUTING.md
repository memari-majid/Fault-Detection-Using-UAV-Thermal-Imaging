## Development Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Contains stable and production-ready code.
- **Development Branch (`develop`)**: Integrates features before they are merged into the main branch.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**: Used for developing new features or fixes.

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow this format:

```
[type]: [short description]

[optional longer description]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Other changes (build process, etc.)

## Testing

- Ensure all new features and fixes are accompanied by appropriate tests.
- Run existing tests to confirm that your changes do not break the project.
- Use `pytest` for running tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## Documentation

- Update the `README.md` and other relevant documentation to reflect your changes.
- Ensure that any new features are well-documented.
